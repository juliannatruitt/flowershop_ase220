**Abstract:**

Floreality is a small flower shop, providing customers with a great
selection of fabulous bouquets. Since sales and stock keep increasing,
Floreality wants to implement a way to store their inventory online and a
way for store management to add new bouquets to the inventory, remove
bouquet, changes details on the bouquets, and more. Our team has
dedicated efforts to create a visually appealing and efficient solution
for Floreality, ensuring that the less tech-savvy management can easily
navigate and utilize the user friendly website without much hassle.

**Proposed Solution:**

-   Pagination:

    -   Instead of management seeing all the flowers just laid out on
        the page, we implemented pagination so that management can see
        three flowers at a time and switch between pages for a clean
        view of the bouquets.

-   Editing:

    -   Management can edit each bouquet, changing the price, name of
        the arrangement, the picture of the flower, the amount and type
        of flowers in the bouquet, and the occasion.

        -   When changing the picture of the flower, be sure to put the
            picture you want to change it to into the "images" folder or
            it will not be able to display the picture!

-   Adding to stock:

    -   Management can add as many bouquets as they would like into the
        website. To add a bouquet, just press on the "stock update" on
        the navigation bar and add the bouquets picture, name, flowers,
        occasion and price. It's as simple as that!

-   Deleting bouquets:

    -   When the store stops providing a bouquet for whatever reason,
        all you must do is press the delete button and the bouquet will
        be removed from the inventory.

-   Details of each bouquet:

    -   To keep things simple, the index page only displays the bouquet
        image, name, and price. To view more information on the bouquet
        such as the occasion for it and the flowers entailed in it, all
        you must do is click the "more information" link and you can see
        all the details that the bouquet has.
